<p align="center"><font face="Trebuchet MS">This is an OCX for Making Gradient 
  Backgrounds. As this is my First Active-X Control in History Please Don't Expect 
  Very High-Fi Coding. Then also I have made this as Clean and Neat as Possible. 
  Just Start the Group1 Project and that's all. Now for the CopyRight. This Control 
  is Yours Forever. It is Free. I just ask for a Vote in Return. That will encourage 
  me to do more work like this in Future. I think it is a Good Bargain. You can 
  use this Control as you wish there are no restrictions. In last I would like 
  to tell you that Please Email me If You Liked it. Thanking You. </font></p>
